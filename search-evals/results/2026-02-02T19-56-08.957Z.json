[...] Managed by Míchel, Girona put together a quietly impressive 2022-23 season – their first in the top flight since 2019 – and managed a 10th place finish, but have made that look ordinary so far this time around with a vast improvement that is reflected in the 2023 rankings, sitting fourth for the year with 77 points from their 41 games played.\n\nTime will tell if Girona’s shrewdly assembled and exceptionally well-drilled side can maintain their title push, but sitting level on points with Real after 18 games is certainly a brilliant indicator of their credentials. [...] The big surprise, though, has been the emergence of surprise package Girona in the Spanish top flight. An already impressive 2023 finished spectacularly with them sitting second in La Liga heading into 2024, surpassing everybody’s expectations.\n\nWe’re not looking at either season today, however. With 2023 out of the way and a new year ushered in, we’re taking a look back at the La Liga standings from the last calendar year in full to see how teams performed and stacked up over 12 months.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti’s side have enjoyed a much more competitive 2023-24 thus far and sit top of the tree, but ultimately struggled to keep pace with both their local and Catalan rivals throughout the year, finishing 10 points behind La Blaugrana last season.",

The player who initially came closest to taking Di Stéfano's record was Portuguese phenomenon Eusébio, the talented striker scoring 47 goals as his Benfica side replaced Madrid as the pre-eminent force in world club football for a time."
