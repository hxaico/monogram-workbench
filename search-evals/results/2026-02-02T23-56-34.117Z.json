[...] The big surprise, though, has been the emergence of surprise package Girona in the Spanish top flight. An already impressive 2023 finished spectacularly with them sitting second in La Liga heading into 2024, surpassing everybody’s expectations.\n\nWe’re not looking at either season today, however. With 2023 out of the way and a new year ushered in, we’re taking a look back at the La Liga standings from the last calendar year in full to see how teams performed and stacked up over 12 months.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti’s side have enjoyed a much more competitive 2023-24 thus far and sit top of the tree, but ultimately struggled to keep pace with both their local and Catalan rivals throughout the year, finishing 10 points behind La Blaugrana last season.",

                  "Real Madrid contested just seven games as they won the inaugural edition, compared to 13 en route to their Champions League victory in 2023/24. The all-time European Cup top ﻿scorer, Alfredo Di Stéfano, struck 49 goals in just 58 appearances in the competition, a goals-per-game rate that none of the modern greats can match. Cristiano Ronaldo is the top scorer of all time in the Champions League and UEFA club competition as well as the most prolific in the history of senior international football.",
                  "The Polish forward was unable to retain his title the following season, Dortmund's Haaland finishing top of the 2020/21 rankings with ten goals, two more than second-ranked Kylian Mbappé, with the two forwards widely predicted to have the same kind of striking competition at the highest level of European football that Ronaldo and Messi enjoyed for more than a decade. That prediction has seemingly played out with Haaland topping the charts again in 2022/23 and Mbappé sharing the honour the following year. 2024/25: Raphinha (Barcelona), Serhou Guirassy (Dortmund) – 13 2023/24: Harry Kane (Ba",
                  "The Argentinian joined Barcelona in early 2001 when he was just 13, and stuck with the team for the next 20 years, winning the Champions League four times in addition to ten La Liga titles, seven editions of the Copa del Rey and three UEFA Super Cups. He was the second player to reach 100 Champions League goals (after Ronaldo) and has been top scorer (or joint-top scorer) in six Champions League seasons, one fewer than Ronaldo has managed.",
                  "Real Madrid won the opening five editions, their Argentinian-born forward Alfredo Di Stéfano racking up 49 goals, a tally that no one was able to match in the 37 seasons before the competition was reinvented as the Champions League. The player who initially came closest to taking Di Stéfano's record was Portuguese phenomenon Eusébio, the talented striker scoring 47 goals as his Benfica side replaced Madrid as the pre-eminent force in world club football for a time."

                  "Even if we did, like last year, it wasn’t enough.” · “I don’t have the ability, once the game is underway, to shift to a different identity and feel secure. Neither I nor the players would understand it well. As a player, I would perceive it as the coach doubting himself, and that’s not good right now.” · Álvaro Arbeloa spoke to the media before this crucial match: “It's extremely important and fundamental, for our aspirations in La Liga, to win tomorrow.",
                  "Arda Güler and Vinicius are looking for ways to create enough danger to go for the second goal, however their shots were stopped correctly, in addition to an inadequate direction on the part of the latter. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal for Real Madrid! The home team has struck! A well-placed pass found Vinicius, who looked for space to shoot. When he found it, he unleashed a powerful shot that beat the goalkeeper perfectly. Many fouls and little effective play in these opening minutes, both teams want to score the first goal of the game, however they have not managed to generate those moments of real damage that give them a good chance.",
                  "Countless fouls have been committed against both teams, neither of them has managed to find a way to orchestrate danger and add the second goal or the goal that would equalize the score for the visitors. Vinicius and Valverde were looking to create a dangerous play that would give them their second goal of the match, but their shot didn't find its target. The ball went out of play without creating anything for Real Madrid.",
                  "I expect the Bernabéu to be behind the team, like they were in the last home game. And like they know we need. I'll always ask for the Bernabéu's support, because with them we're much stronger. They know that our objective, obviously, is to win on Sunday; to continue fighting for La Liga, a title we're battling for..."
