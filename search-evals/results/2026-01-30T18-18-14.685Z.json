On 15 June, East German leader Walter Ulbricht declared that 'no one has the intention of building a wall', but on the night of 12-13 August a wire barrier was constructed around West Berlin. From this barbed wire barricade, the Wall would eventually develop into a fortified concrete structure encircling West Berlin and isolating it from the surrounding East German territory. The Berlin Wall was under the constant surveillance of armed East German border guards who were authorised to shoot anyone attempting to escape into West Berlin. ## Why did the Berlin Wall fall?

Communist Party spokesperson Günter Schabowski held a press conference to announce the new measures, in which he was asked by a journalist when the changes would take effect. Having missed part of the briefing earlier in the day, Schabowski replied: “Das tritt nach meiner Kenntnis... ist das sofort... unverzüglich” (\"As far as I know... effective immediately, without delay\"). East and West Berliners erupted in jubilation, and spontaneous demonstrations and celebrations saw thousands mount the wall that had divided the city for decades. East Berliners began pouring into West Berlin while civilians set about destroying the wall.

Erected in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing to the West, the wall became a powerful symbol of repression and political division. Over its twenty-eight-year existence, it was responsible for the deaths of many individuals attempting to escape its confines, highlighting the harsh realities of life in East Germany under Communist rule.

Repressive political policies, collectivization of land, nationalization of industry, and imprisonment of anyone opposed to the authorities became common in the Eastern Bloc. This political disintegration reached its height on August 13, 1961, when the Soviet Union’s leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, ordered that the thirteen-foot-high, steel and concrete Berlin Wall be built, ostensibly to stop a “population hemorrhage”—the flight of unhappy East Germans to the West—that was draining East Germany’s economy. The next twenty-eight years produced a multitude of political crises, from the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 to the execution of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu on December 25, 1989.",

Construction of the Berlin Wall was commenced by the government of the GDR on 13 August 1961. It included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the \"death strip\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defenses.

After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit the FRG and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall, joined by West Germans on the other side, and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall over the next few weeks.

Although changes in the GDR leadership and\nencouraging speeches by Gorbachev about nonintervention in Eastern Europe\nboded well for reunification, the world was taken by surprise when, during\nthe night of November 9, 1989, crowds of Germans began dismantling the\nBerlin Wall—a barrier that for almost 30 years had symbolized the Cold War\ndivision of Europe. By October 1990, Germany was reunified, triggering the\nswift collapse of the other East European regimes.\nPeople celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nSection Title: A Short History of the Department of State > The Berlin Wall Falls and USSR Dissolves\nContent:\nThirteen months later, on December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the Union\nof Soviet Socialist Republics dissolved. President Bush and his chief\nforeign policy advisers were more pro-active toward Russia and the former\nSoviet republics after the collapse of the Communist monolith than while it\nwas teetering. In a series of summits during the next year with the new\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin, Bush pledged $4.5-billion to support\neconomic reform in Russia, as well as additional credit guarantees and\ntechnical assistance.\nSection Title: A Short History of the Department of State > The Berlin Wall Falls and USSR Dissolves\nContent:\nThe two former Cold War adversaries lifted restrictions on the numbers and\nmovement of diplomatic, consular, and official personnel. They also agreed\nto continue the [Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty negotiations (START)](/milestones/1989-1992/strategic-arms-reduction) , begun\nbefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, which set a goal of reducing their\nstrategic nuclear arsenals from approximately 12,000 warheads to 3,000-3,500\nwarheads by 2003. In January 1993, three weeks before leaving office, Bush\ntraveled to Moscow to sign the START II Treaty that codified those nuclear\nreductions.\nSection Title: A Short History of the Department of State > Table of Contents\nContent:\n[Foundations of Foreign Affairs, 1775-1823](/departmenthistory/short-history/foundations)\n[The Expansionist Years, 1823-1867](/departmenthistory/short-history/expansion)\n[Rise to World Power, 1867-1913](/departmenthistory/short-history/worldpower)\n[The Challenge of Global Conflict, 1913-1945](/departmenthistory/short-history/globalconflict)\n[Containment and Cold War, 1945-1961](/departmenthistory/short-history/containmentandcoldwar)\n[Superpowers Collide, 1961-1981](/departmenthistory/short-history/superpowers)\n[The End of the Cold War, 1981-1992](/departmenthistory/short-history/endofcoldwar)\n[The Berlin Wall Falls and USSR Dissolves](/departmenthistory/short-history/berlinwall)\nSection Title: A Short History of the Department of State > Department History\nContent:\n[Buildings of the Department](/departmenthistory/buildings)\n[Biographies of the Secretaries of State](/departmenthistory/people/secretaries)\n[Principal Officers and Chiefs of Mission](/departmenthistory/people/principals-chiefs)\n[Travels of the President](/departmenthistory/travels/president)\n[Travels of the Secretary](/departmenthistory/travels/secretary)\n[Visits by Foreign Leaders](/departmenthistory/visits)\n[World War I and the Department](/departmenthistory/wwi)\n[U.S. Diplomatic Couriers](/departmenthistory/diplomatic-couriers)"

A Border already existed, but this new physical barrier meant that the city was completely separated.\nThe speed at which this happened came as a shock to residents from both sides. Its construction parted families, destroyed buildings and changed the entire cityscape.\nHere are some of the original Berlin Wall sections on display in Potsdamer Platz. When the Berlin Wall was first constructed it was formed of bricks, barbed wire and concrete blocks.\nBut by the 1980s large sections of it were much more sophisticated. L-shaped, reinforced concrete slabs like this one were lined up alongside each other to create a solid structure over 3 meters high.\n ... \nSection Title: What was the Berlin Wall and how did it fall? > Life in divided Berlin > Transcript\nContent:\nThe last person to be killed by shooting while trying to escape was 20 year old Chris Gueffroy, pictured here, in February 1989.

He failed to clarify that some regulations would remain in place.\nWestern media inaccurately reported that the border had opened and crowds quickly gathered at checkpoints on both sides of the Wall.\nPassport checks were eventually abandoned and people crossed the border unrestricted.\nThe political, economic and social impact of the fall of the Berlin Wall further weakened the already unstable East German government.\nSection Title: What was the Berlin Wall and how did it fall? > The Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989\nContent:\nGermany reunited on 3 October 1990, 11 months after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n ... \nSection Title: What was the Berlin Wall and how did it fall? > Why did the Berlin Wall fall? > Transcript\nContent:\nIn the early hours of 10 November 1989, thousands of people from both sides of the border gathered here, at the iconic Brandenburg Gate.

                "Section Title: The Berlin Wall > Index\nContent:\nThe 155-kilometer-long Berlin Wall, which cut through the middle of the city center, surrounded West Berlin from August 13, 1961 to November 9, 1989. The Wall was designed to prevent people from escaping to the West from East Berlin. In 1961, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( SED) began adding additional obstacles to the border, expanding the Wall into a complex multi-layered system of barriers. In the West, the border strip was referred to as the “death strip” because so many people were killed there while trying to escape. In 1989, the Wall that the SED had used for so long to maintain its power in the GDR, fell. With the fall of the Wall, the dictatorship came to its definitive end.\nSection Title: The Berlin Wall > Building the Wall in August 1961\nContent:\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, the SED, the state party of the GDR, established a dictatorship in East Germany with the support of the Soviet occupying power. A large part of the East German population did not agree with the new political and economic system. By the late 1940s, a mass migration to the West was underway. People had different reasons – political, economic and personal – for wanting to leave. By August 1961, the GDR had lost a sixth of its population – at least four million people. The SED had already closed off East Germany’s border with West Germany in 1952, making it increasingly dangerous to cross there. But the sector borders in Berlin remained open, leading many to try to reach West Germany through this last opening.\n ... \nSection Title: The Berlin Wall > Expanding the Border Fortifications\nContent:\nIn the beginning, when a successful escape occurred, border soldiers and pioneer units added temporary, individual barriers to a specific site behind the border wall. After the border area was established behind the Wall on the East Berlin side in 1963, a fence was added to block off large parts of this area. In the mid-1960s, the SED tore down several buildings to make room for a uniform border strip that provided border soldiers with an “unobstructed view and clear field of fire.” Over the following years this border strip was continually expanded and improved. In the 1970s, a second “inner wall” was added, blocking off the border strip to East Berlin and the GDR.\nThe border Wall at Potsdamer Platz © Berlin Wall Foundation, Photo: Michael-Reiner Ernst\n ... \nSection Title: The Berlin Wall > The Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989\nContent:\nAt the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE conference) in Helsinki in 1975, the SED agreed in principle, albeit without wanting to admit it, to the rights of people to move freely and enjoy freedom of travel. Afterwards, more and more GDR citizens submitted applications to immigrate permanently to West Germany. An opposition movement also developed in the 1980s that expressed pointed criticism of the political and social conditions in the GDR. The general public, angered by environmental pollution and economic stagnation, turned away from the SED state. Similar developments were taking place in other Eastern Bloc countries, such as Poland, where the independent trade union Solidarność achieved national recognition in November 1980. After Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union in 1985, the political situation in the Eastern Bloc slowly began to change.\nSection Title: The Berlin Wall > The Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989\nContent:\nGorbachev introduced internal political reforms to solve serious economic and social problems. In 1988 he abandoned the Brezhnev Doctrine, a central political principle of Soviet foreign policy that demanded limited sovereignty of the Warsaw Pact nations. This change allowed the Eastern Bloc states to set their own national policies. Hungary’s shift towards the West led it to demonstratively dismantle its border fence on May 2, 1989. The first hole was made in the “Iron Curtain.”\nSection Title: The Berlin Wall > The Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989\nContent:\nThe SED was not interested in adopting the Soviet Union’s reform course in the GDR. But the country’s growing protest movement and the migration wave to the West in the late 1980s brought the dictatorship to an end in 1989. The SED had been compelled to make concessions, such as opening up travel to its citizens. When a new travel law was mistakenly announced on November 9, 1989, crowds rushed to the border, which was opened under the onslaught of so many people. The fall of the Wall led to the ultimate collapse of the GDR.\nCelebrating people on the wall at the Brandenburg Gate the day after the fall of the wall. 10 November 1989 © Berlin Wall Foundation, Photo: Michael-Reiner Ernst\nSection Title: The Berlin Wall > The Demolition of the Wall and the Preserved Relics\nContent:\nThe demolition of the Wall began soon after the border opened. So-called “wall peckers” broke off pieces of concrete as souvenirs. New border crossings were created, leaving behind large gaps in the Wall. Border soldiers began dismantling the signal fence and other border obstacles. Both the GDR government and the border troops began thinking about ways of marketing the Wall. Pieces of the Wall were sold all over the world.\nIn June 1990 the systematic dismantling of the border grounds began at Ackerstrasse, between the districts of Wedding (West Berlin) and Mitte (former East Berlin), and was basically finished by the year’s end. The East Berlin magistrate placed the first sections of the Wall, including the section on Bernauer Strasse, under protection as a historical monument in 1990.\nDemolished wall remains, Berlin Summer 1990 © Berlin Wall Foundation, Photo: Ute Hoog"

He is consistently ranked among the best English writers of the 20th century, and his writing has had a huge, lasting influence on contemporary culture. Several of his coined words have since entered the English language, and the word \"Orwellian\" is now used to describe totalitarian or authoritarian social practices.\n\n## Product details [...] 1984 is George Orwell’s haunting prophecy of the future, which has held multiple generations of readers spellbound in its chilling and terrifying vision of life under a dictatorship. Powerful and unforgettable, this still-relevant novel, written in 1948, explores the obliteration of truth, individuality, and liberty in a world where the ruling power seeks to control everything, from information to thought and memory.\n\n### About the Author [...] \"1984\" by George Orwell deserves its place as a classic in the realm of dystopian literature, and I'm giving it a solid four stars for its enduring relevance and thought-provoking themes.  \n    \n  This novel is a stark and chilling portrayal of a totalitarian society where Big Brother watches your every move, and individual freedom is but a distant memory. George Orwell's ability to craft a dystopian world that is both frighteningly believable and thought-provoking is commendable. The bleakness of the society he depicts is a powerful warning about the dangers of surveillance, censorship, and the manipulation of truth.",

              "content": "Writing under the pen name George Orwell, Eric Blair composed “1984” on the Scottish island of Jura between 1946 and 1948 while suffering from tuberculosis. He died in 1950, about seven months after the book was published to widespread acclaim, coining terms including “Big Brother,” “doublethink” and “newspeak.” The bestselling novel remains widely assigned in high school and college courses, with many continuing to cite its relevance today in discussions about government censorship, surveillance and manipulation of truth.\n\nAs part of Brown Professor of Comparative Literature Esther Whitfield’s Writing and Censorship course, students visit the Hay Library to consult materials, including “1984,” that have been subject to censorship at some point in their history. [...] PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — Millions have read the opening line of George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984”: “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”\n\nBut far fewer readers are aware that the author initially wrote it as: “It was a cold blowy day in early April, and a million radios were striking thirteen.”\n\nThat revision and many others are handwritten on Orwell’s original manuscript of the 1949 novel, housed in the Brown University Library’s special collections at the John Hay Library. Students and scholars alike can glean insights into the author’s writing process by studying the artifact, which is thought to be Orwell’s only surviving manuscript, according to Head of Special Collections Instruction Heather Cole. [...] The novel was censored in the former Soviet republics and in Cuba, given its thinly veiled critique of communism, and it has been banned in some local communities in the U.S. in the years since its publication “for sometimes inscrutable reasons,” according to Whitfield.\n\n“It is a privilege to be able to consult the manuscript of such a monumental book, and to see the handwritten changes Orwell made to his typed pages,” Whitfield said. “It opens a window to his process as a writer and shows us the alternatives he considered for some of the most important sections of the novel. For a literature course in particular, this kind of close reading is valuable.”",

[...] ## Who Was George Orwell?\n\nGeorge Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair, was an English novelist, essayist, and critic best known for his books Animal Farm and 1984. He was a man of strong opinions who addressed some of the major political movements of his time, including imperialism, fascism, and communism. His foresight into how easily a democracy can slide into totalitarianism inspired the word “Orwellian,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary, especially the totalitarian state he wrote about in 1984. Beyond his literary career, Orwell worked as an officer for the India Imperial Police Force and fought in the Spanish Civil War. He died in 1950 at age 46 after suffering from tuberculosis for many years.\n\n## Quick Facts [...] Orwell’s final novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984 in later editions), was published in 1949, when he was in the late stages of his battle with tuberculosis and soon before his death. This bleak vision of the world divided into three oppressive nations stirred up controversy among reviewers, who found this fictional future too despairing. In the novel, Orwell gave readers a glimpse into what would happen if the government controlled every detail of a person’s life, down to their own private thoughts.",

The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it's almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down. [...] So let’s move on to the novel and head on down to Room 101. As I said earlier, 1984 can be read as a culmination of a lot of his themes and ideas across his short career. Warning of totalitarianism arrives everywhere with Orwell, such as Burmese Days when he describes the town as ‘a stifling, stultifying world…which every word and every thought is censored,’ not unlike 1984 because ‘free speech is unthinkable.’ And one can read in Keep the Aspidistra Flying, with Comstock (a name derived from Common and Stock similarly to how the terms in 1984 are often truncated phrases) bemoaning ‘I’m dead, You’re dead. We’re all dead people in a dead world,’ as a precursor to the pivotal moment when Winston and Jane declare ‘we’re dead’ right before being exposed as having been set up. For Orwell, [...] Which becomes a pretty important distinction, as Orwell believed in better form of governing yet also was suspicious of anyone who would seek out power in order to change it as he writes in the novel ‘we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.’ I feel 1984 is best read with an openness to nuance and in good faith, which is often glossed over for the sake of political identifying which is, ironically or not, the exact thing he was warning against. Which is to say, call out problems even if it’s your own “side” and don’t create further divide by abusing rhetoric for the sake of scoring quick political points.",

His non-fiction works, including ***The Road to Wigan Pier*** (1937), documenting his experience of working-class life in the industrial north of England, and ***Homage to Catalonia*** (1938), an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), are as critically respected as his essays on politics, literature, language and culture.\n ... \nSection Title: 1984 > Ratings & Reviews > Community Reviews\nContent:\nThis book is far from perfect. Its characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin’s *We* , and the lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face.\nBut in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right.\nOrwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their \"alternative facts\" was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word for truth.\n ... \nSection Title: 1984 > Ratings & Reviews > Community Reviews\nContent:\n*1984* is not a particularly good novel, but it is a very good essay. On the novel front, the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through. As a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded, and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling. As an essay, the points it makes can be earthshaking. It seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a 1984-dystopia. Every administration that reaches for power, injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing Big Brother.\n ... \nSection Title: 1984 > Ratings & Reviews > Community Reviews\nContent:\nThough with a president making statements like “What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,” naturally one is reminded of Orwell writing ‘ *the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,* ’ and we are reminded of the power of literature and how we often turn to great works for guidance during uncertain times, though often, as Orwell warned, using it as propaganda shorn of context. Orwell did live long enough to see the novel used improperly, having to put out a statement almost immediately for those who wished to use the novel as an example against the British Labor Party. ‘ *My recent novel is NOT an on Socialism or on the British Labor Party (of which I am a supporter),* ’ he wrote, and an introduction to the book states:"

With each lie he writes, Winston grows to hate the Party that seeks power for its own sake and persecutes those who dare to commit thoughtcrimes. But as he starts to think for himself, Winston can’t escape the fact that Big Brother is always watching...\nA startling and haunting novel, 1984 creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing from start to finish.

He was essentially a political writer who focused his attention on his own times, a man of intense feelings and intense hates. An opponent of totalitarianism, he served in the Loyalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. Besides his classic Animal Farm , his works include a novel based on his experiences as a colonial policeman, Burmese Days , two firsthand studies of poverty, Down and Out in Paris and London and The Road to Wigan Pier , an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, Homage to Catalonia ; and the extraordinary novel of political prophecy whose title became part of our language, 1984 .\n ... \nSection Title: 1984: 75th Anniversary Paperback – Unabridged, July 1, 1950 > About the authors\nContent:\nHe spent six months in Morocco and there wrote Coming Up for Air. During the Second World War he served in the Home Guard and worked for the BBC Eastern Service from 1941 to 1943. As literary editor of the Tribune he contributed a regular page of political and literary commentary, and he also wrote for the Observer and later for the Manchester Evening News. His unique political allegory, Animal Farm was published in 1945, and it was this novel, together with Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), which brought him world-wide fame.It was around this time that Orwell's unique political allegory Animal Farm (1945) was published. The novel is recognised as a classic of modern political satire and is simultaneously an engaging story and convincing allegory. It was this novel, together with Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), which finally brought him world-wide fame.\nSection Title: 1984: 75th Anniversary Paperback – Unabridged, July 1, 1950 > About the authors\nContent:\nNineteen Eighty-Four's ominous depiction of a repressive, totalitarian regime shocked contemporary readers, but ensures that the book remains perhaps the preeminent dystopian novel of modern literature.Orwell's fiercely moral writing has consistently struck a chord with each passing generation. The intense honesty and insight of his essays and non-fiction made Orwell one of the foremost social commentators of his age. Added to this, his ability to construct elaborately imaginative fictional worlds, which he imbued with this acute sense of morality, has undoubtedly assured his contemporary and future relevance.George Orwell died in London in January 1950.\nSection Title: 1984: 75th Anniversary Paperback – Unabridged, July 1, 1950 > About the authors\nContent:\n[See more on the author's page](/George-Orwell/e/B000AQ0KKY/ref=aufs_dp_mata_dsk)\n[## David Apricot](/David-Apricot/e/B0CV3WKC5C/ref=aufs_dp_mata_dsk)Brief content visible, double tap to read full content.Full content visible, double tap to read brief content.David Apricot is an American Expat who lives in Australia.

This book is a clear reaction to and comment on the Soviet takeover of it’s own country and especially Eastern Europe that was occurring while Orwell wrote.Orwell, who I just learned died young at age 46 years old, just a few years after the book came out in 1949, wrote this book in 1947 in the middle of that take over, and it is interesting to read it again, 75 years later, to hear Orwell’s thoughts on what was occurring, as it was occurring anew.As I am writing this in 2023, Russia is trying to wipe out Ukrainian culture, saying it never was a country, systematically bombing its museums and cultural buildings and television towers, forcing residents to use Russian money and passports, and forcing schools in Ukraine to only use the Russian language and Russian textbooks."

It has one of the highest atomic numbers of any element that occurs naturally. An atomic number measures the number of protons contained in the nucleus of each atom comprising an element. The higher an element's atomic number, the heavier it will be. This is why gold is so dense and heavy. Gold is one of the least reactive and most solid chemical elements. It is also the most malleable of all metals. In fact, a single ounce of gold could be compressed into a thin sheet that would span a total of 300 square feet. When formed into a monotonic wire it can be stretched about twice before it would break, making it optimal for microelectronics and other applications.

It has one of the highest atomic numbers of any element that occurs naturally. An atomic number measures the number of protons contained in the nucleus of each atom comprising an element. The higher an element's atomic number, the heavier it will be. This is why gold is so dense and heavy. Gold is one of the least reactive and most solid chemical elements. It is also the most malleable of all metals. In fact, a single ounce of gold could be compressed into a thin sheet that would span a total of 300 square feet. When formed into a monotonic wire, it can be stretched about twice before it would break, making it optimal for microelectronics and other applications.\nSection Title: ... > Where the Chemical Symbol AU Comes From: Did You Know? – Video Transcription\nContent:\nGold's chemical symbol AU is derived from the Latin word aurum, meaning gold. Some claim that the word aurum also means shining dawn due to its etymological ties to the word aurora, meaning dawn. The word gold comes from the old English word for yellow, geolu, which was derived from the Germanic word gulþa. Today, gold is everywhere, and in many of the devices we use on a daily basis.

Gold's soft composition means that it will often be found in alloy form in jewellery, mixed with other metals such as silver or copper to make the metal more durable.\nGold is also a highly conductive metal, making it ideal for use in tiny amounts in the creation of computer chips, as well as to protect copper wires and other parts in electrical appliances, protecting the components from corrosion.\nSection Title: What is the Chemical Symbol for Gold?\nContent:\nAs a noble metal, gold is resistant to corrosion and oxidation. This is a trait that gold shares with silver, platinum and palladium and the ability to not rust or corrode is undoubtedly a large factor in their classification as precious metals.

When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, [...] According to Chris Kraft, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book. Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a [...] Problems playing this file?

When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his way down the ladder. At the bottom of the ladder, while standing on a Lunar Module landing pad, Armstrong said, \"I'm going to step off the LM now\". He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969, then said, \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" The exact time of Armstrong's first step on the Moon is unclear.",

[...] At 9:32 a.m. on July 16, with the world watching, Apollo 11 took off from Kennedy Space Center with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins aboard. Armstrong, a 38-year-old research pilot, was the commander of the mission. After traveling 240,000 miles in 76 hours, Apollo 11 entered a lunar orbit on July 19. The next day, at 1:46 p.m., the lunar module Eagle, manned by Armstrong and Aldrin, separated from the command module, where Collins remained. Two hours later, the Eagle began its descent to the lunar surface, and at 4:18 p.m. the craft touched down on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong immediately radioed to Mission Control in Houston, Texas, a famous message: “The Eagle has landed.” [...] 1:02m watch\n\nAt 10:39 p.m., five hours ahead of the original schedule, Armstrong opened the hatch of the lunar module. As he made his way down the lunar module’s ladder, a television camera attached to the craft recorded his progress and beamed the signal back to Earth, where hundreds of millions watched in great anticipation. At 10:56 p.m., Armstrong spoke his famous quote, which he later contended was slightly garbled by his microphone and meant to be “that’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” He then planted his left foot on the gray, powdery surface, took a cautious step forward, and humanity had walked on the moon.",

Was it just to beat the Soviets? Learn about the events that led to the creation of the Apollo Program.\n4:51m watch\nIn 1966, after five years of work by an international team of scientists and engineers, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) conducted the first unmanned Apollo test flight, trying out the structural integrity of the proposed launch vehicle and spacecraft combination. Then, on January 27, 1967, tragedy struck at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, [Florida](/topics/us-states/florida) , when a fire broke out during a manned launch-pad test of the Apollo spacecraft and *Saturn* rocket. Three astronauts were killed in the fire.\nSection Title: Neil Armstrong walks on moon > Did the US Go to the Moon to Beat the Soviets?\nContent:\nDespite the setback, NASA and its thousands of workers forged ahead, and in October 1968, *Apollo 7,* the first manned Apollo mission, orbited Earth and successfully tested many of the sophisticated systems needed to conduct a moon journey and landing. In December of the same year, *Apollo 8* took three astronauts around the far side of the moon and orbited it 10 times before returning, and in March 1969 *Apollo 9* tested the lunar module for the first time while in Earth orbit. Then in May, the three astronauts of *Apollo 10* took the first complete Apollo spacecraft in 31 orbits around the moon in a dry run for the scheduled July landing mission.\nSection Title: Neil Armstrong walks on moon > Did the US Go to the Moon to Beat the Soviets?\nContent:\nAt 9:32 a.m. on July 16, with the world watching, *Apollo 11* took off from Kennedy Space Center with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin Jr., and [Michael Collins](/topics/astronaut-michael-collins) aboard. Armstrong, a 38-year-old research pilot, was the commander of the mission. After traveling 240,000 miles in 76 hours, *Apollo 11* entered a lunar orbit on July 19. The next day, at 1:46 p.m., the lunar module *Eagle,* manned by Armstrong and Aldrin, separated from the command module, where Collins remained. Two hours later, the *Eagle* began its descent to the lunar surface, and at 4:18 p.m. the craft touched down on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong immediately radioed to Mission Control in Houston, [Texas](/topics/us-states/texas) , a famous message: “The *Eagle* has landed.”\nSection Title: Neil Armstrong walks on moon > ... > Apollo 11: They Almost Forgot the American Flag\nContent:\nAuthor Charles Fishman discusses how the Apollo 11 astronauts almost didn't bring a flag to the moon.\n1:02m watch\nAt 10:39 p.m., five hours ahead of the original schedule, Armstrong opened the hatch of the lunar module. As he made his way down the lunar module’s ladder, a television camera attached to the craft recorded his progress and beamed the signal back to Earth, where hundreds of millions watched in great anticipation. At 10:56 p.m., Armstrong spoke his famous quote, which he later contended was slightly garbled by his microphone and meant to be “that’s one small step for *a* man, one giant leap for mankind.” He then planted his left foot on the gray, powdery surface, took a cautious step forward, and humanity had walked on the moon.\nSection Title: Neil Armstrong walks on moon > ... > Apollo 11: They Almost Forgot the American Flag\nContent:\n“Buzz” Aldrin joined him on the moon’s surface at 11:11 p.m., and together they took photographs of the terrain, planted a U.S. flag, ran a few simple scientific tests, and spoke with President [Richard M. Nixon](/topics/us-presidents/richard-m-nixon) via Houston. By 1:11 a.m. on July 21, both astronauts were back in the lunar module and the hatch was closed. The two men slept that night on the surface of the moon, and at 1:54 p.m. the *Eagle* began its ascent back to the command module. Among the items left on the surface of the moon was a plaque that read: “Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon–July 1969 A.D–We came in peace for all mankind.”\nAt 5:35 p.m., Armstrong and Aldrin successfully docked and rejoined Collins, and at 12:56 a.m. on July 22 *Apollo 11* began its journey home, safely splashing down in the Pacific Ocean at 12:51 p.m. on July 24.\nSection Title: Neil Armstrong walks on moon > ... > Apollo 11: They Almost Forgot the American Flag\nContent:\nThere would be five more successful lunar landing missions, and one unplanned lunar swing-by, *Apollo 13* . The last men to walk on the moon, astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt of the *Apollo 17* mission, left the lunar surface on December 14, 1972. The Apollo program was a costly and labor-intensive endeavor, involving an estimated 400,000 engineers, technicians, and scientists, and costing $24 billion (close to $100 billion in today’s dollars). The expense was justified by Kennedy’s 1961 mandate to beat the Soviets to the moon, and after the feat was accomplished ongoing missions lost their viability."

Today, August 5 would have been his 94th birthday (1930-2012).**\nNeil Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930 in Wapakoneta, Ohio. After being captivated by flight from an early age, Armstrong began flying as a teenager. He had obtained his pilot’s license by the time he was 16, quite an achievement considering he hadn’t even graduated high school.\nHe served as a naval aviator from 1949 until 1952. During that time, he flew 78 combat missions during the Korean War, earning two Gold Stars and the Air Medal. Armstrong is pictured here as an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve in 1952. After serving on active duty, he entered the Naval Reserve and returned to Purdue to complete his degree in Aeronautical Engineering.\nSection Title: Blog > Neil Armstrong: the First Human to Walk on the Moon\nContent:\nArmstrong applied for a position with NACA, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (the predecessor of NASA), and began his career as a test pilot. While working as a test pilot, he flew many types of aircraft, from the famous Bell X-1B, the X-15 rocket plane, fighters, bombers, tankers, and transports.\nThe X-15 program investigated hypersonic flight and provided information that was used in NASA programs from Project Mercury to the Space Shuttle. Test pilots operating the X-15 were air-dropped from a modified B-52 bomber from about 45,000 feet; after which the rocket engine on the X-15 was ignited. This rocket engine gave pilots quite a kick for the first minute and a half to two minutes of their flights.\nSection Title: Blog > Neil Armstrong: the First Human to Walk on the Moon\nContent:\nArmstrong became a civilian test pilot for NASA after the nascent space agency absorbed the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on October 1, 1958. His status as a civilian test pilot precluded his ability to apply as an astronaut for Project Mercury since those flights were limited to military test pilots.\nNASA decided to open up astronaut applications to civilian test pilots with jet experience, 1,500 hours of flying time, and who were under 35 years old. Armstrong, age 32, was selected as one of the “New Nine” or Astronaut Group 2 on September 17, 1962.\nBefore flying into space, Armstrong trained as the backup Command Pilot for Gemini 5. Armstrong’s first spaceflight was during Gemini 8 along with astronaut David Scott, and they are pictured here in their crew portrait. This mission was supposed to run three days, but it was cut short after a problem with the maneuvering thrusters on the Gemini spacecraft.\n ... \nSection Title: Blog > Neil Armstrong: the First Human to Walk on the Moon\nContent:\nOn July 16, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins sat atop one of NASA’s behemoth Saturn V rockets. Their mission, the first human landing on the Moon. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the controls of the Lunar Module *Eagle* and started their descent to the lunar surface.\nThe final seconds of the mission were hair-raising when Armstrong took control of the Lunar Module to avoid a field of boulders strewn across their landing site. With seconds of fuel remaining, Armstrong was able to land the *Eagle* at 4:17 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\nBoth astronauts were due to enter a brief rest period after landing, but it was skipped so the astronauts could perform their EVA. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon at 10:56 p.m. EST.\nSection Title: Blog > Neil Armstrong: the First Human to Walk on the Moon\nContent:\nAs he stepped on the lunar surface, Armstrong spoke one of the most memorable phrases in human history. “That’s one small step for Man, one giant leap for mankind.”\nBuzz Aldrin followed Armstrong to the surface a short time later. The entire EVA for Apollo 11 lasted over “two-and-a-half hours, ending at 111 hours, 39 minutes into the mission.” Command Module Pilot, Astronaut Michael Collins flew alone in lunar orbit as Armstrong and Aldrin were on the lunar surface. Once Armstrong and Aldrin had completed their EVA, *Eagle* lifted off the Moon and met with the command module *Columbia* for rendezvous and headed back to Earth.\nThese first steps will almost certainly go down in human history as the most important event of the 20th century.\nSection Title: Blog > Neil Armstrong: the First Human to Walk on the Moon\nContent:\nAfter retiring from NASA in 1971, he began teaching engineering at the University of Cincinnati. Armstrong was also involved with various NASA commissions, from the investigation into the loss of the Space Shuttle *Challenger* , to the Apollo 13 incident.\nAugust 2012, Armstrong developed complications in the hospital due to a recent bypass surgery to relieve coronary artery disease and died on August 25, 2012, in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the age of 82.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the incredible life of the first human to set foot upon another world, check out [“First Man: The Life of Neil A.

Having overseen the successful launch of ChatGPT in 2022, he is widely considered to be one of the leading figures of the AI boom. [...] On November 20, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Altman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. Two days later, OpenAI employees published an open letter to the board threatening to leave OpenAI and join Microsoft, where all employees had been promised jobs, unless all board members step down and reinstate Altman as CEO. 505 employees initially signed, which later grew to over 700 out of 770 total employees. This included Ilya Sutskever, who initially advocated for firing Altman, but then stated on Twitter \"I regret my participation in the board's actions.\" Late in the night on November 20, OpenAI announced that they had reached an \"agreement in principle\" for Altman to return as CEO and Brockman to return as president. On November 21, 2023, after [...] In March 2019, Altman left Y Combinator to focus full time as CEO of OpenAI. OpenAI planned to spend $1 billion \"within five years, and possibly much faster\". Altman stated that even a billion dollars may turn out to be insufficient, and that the lab may ultimately need \"more capital than any non-profit has ever raised\" to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\n#### Release of ChatGPT\n\nIn December 2022, OpenAI received widespread media coverage after launching a free preview of ChatGPT, a new AI chatbot based on GPT-3.5. According to OpenAI, the preview received over a million signups within the first five days. According to anonymous sources cited by Reuters in December 2022, OpenAI Global, LLC was projecting $200 million of revenue in 2023 and $1 billion in revenue in 2024.",

              "content": "On November 18, 2023, there were reportedly talks of Altman returning as CEO amid pressure placed upon the board by investors such as Microsoft and Thrive Capital, who objected to Altman's departure. Although Altman himself spoke in favor of returning to OpenAI, he has since stated that he considered starting a new company and bringing former OpenAI employees with him if talks to reinstate him didn't work out. The board members agreed \"in principle\" to resign if Altman returned. On November 19, 2023, negotiations with Altman to return failed and Murati was replaced by Emmett Shear as interim CEO. The board initially contacted Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei (a former OpenAI executive) about replacing Altman, and proposed a merger of the two companies, but both offers were declined. [...] In February 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that the company is interested in collaborating with the People's Republic of China, despite regulatory restrictions imposed by the U.S. government. This shift comes in response to the growing influence of the Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek, which has disrupted the AI market with open models, including DeepSeek V3 and DeepSeek R1. Following DeepSeek's market emergence, OpenAI enhanced security protocols to protect proprietary development techniques from industrial espionage. Some industry observers noted similarities between DeepSeek's model distillation approach and OpenAI's methodology, though no formal intellectual property claim was filed. [...] On November 20, 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Altman and Brockman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team, but added that they were still committed to OpenAI despite recent events. Before the partnership with Microsoft was finalized, Altman gave the board another opportunity to negotiate with him. About 738 of OpenAI's 770 employees, including Murati and Sutskever, signed an open letter stating they would quit their jobs and join Microsoft if the board did not rehire Altman and then resign. This prompted OpenAI investors to consider legal action against the board as well. In response, OpenAI management sent an internal memo to employees stating that negotiations with Altman and the board had resumed and would take some time.",

OpenAI is pushing an aggressive expansion – encroaching on industries like e-commerce, [healthcare](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/05/chatgpt-openai-health-insurance-aca) and entertainment – while increasingly integrating its products into government, universities and the US military and making a play to turn ChatGPT into the new default homepage for millions.\nSection Title: Sam Altman’s make-or-break year: can the OpenAI CEO cash in his bet on the future?\nContent:\nAltman’s long bid to make himself the power broker of a new, AI-powered society has started to look closer to reality as a large portion of the US economy now rides on the success of his vision. There are reports the company is preparing to [go public](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/) towards the end of 2026 with up to a $1tn valuation in one of the biggest initial public offerings in history.\n ... \nSection Title: Sam Altman’s make-or-break year: can the OpenAI CEO cash in his bet on the future?\nContent:\nIn an effort to maintain investor confidence in this profit-free spending spree and avoid regulatory crackdowns, Altman has intensified a charm offensive over the past year, deepened his political connections and promised even more from [OpenAI](https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/technology/openai) – with the company claiming that AI will soon be a utility “on par with electricity, clean water, or food”. The CEO has also expanded his personal portfolio, backing new energy and neuroscience technologies just as other tech moguls have. This year will test: can he maintain the relentless balancing act?\n ... \nSection Title: ... > **Altman and OpenAI get political**\nContent:\nOpenAI also hired consultants and lobbyists from across the political spectrum, including those who have worked for the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. They have also brought on the former deputy chief of staff for the Republican senator Lindsey Graham and a former staffer from the Senate foreign relations committee.\nThe company’s most effective campaigner does not hail from K Street, however. It has been Altman himself, who has joined other tech moguls in ingratiating themselves with Donald Trump and allying themselves with the current administration. He has dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and appeared at the White House for an event touting the administration’s ties with the tech industry. In September, Altman was one of several tech CEOs who joined Trump and King Charles for a state dinner in the UK.\n ... \nSection Title: ... > **Turning toward Trump**\nContent:\nAltman’s appearances and apparent friendliness are a stark turnaround from his earlier view of Trump, which he expressed in a mid-2016 blogpost that likened Trump’s rise to Hitler’s.\n“To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action,” Altman wrote in 2016 before Trump’s election win. “He is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are.”\nBut as Trump’s second term began, Altman posted a message lauding the president and recanting his previous opposition.\n“Watching @potus more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him (i wish i had done more of my own thinking and definitely fell in the npc trap),” Altman posted on X days after Trump’s inauguration. “I’m not going to agree with him on everything, but i think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!”\n ... \nSection Title: ... > **Nuclear energy, longevity pills, brain scans**\nContent:\n[Share](mailto:?subject=Sam Altman’s make-or-break year: can the OpenAI CEO cash in his bet on the future?&body=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2026/jan/25/sam-altman-openai?CMP=share_btn_url)\n ... \nSection Title: Sam Altman’s make-or-break year: can the OpenAI CEO cash in his bet on the future? > Most viewed\nContent:\n[Back to top]()\n© 2026 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We remain focused on the same core—pursuing frontier AI research that accelerates human progress—but we now also deliver products used by hundreds of millions of people. This real-world usage—in science, business, education and more—helps make our research better and helps begin to deliver on our mission of AGI that benefits all of humanity.\nAs we scale, I am proud to announce three of our leaders are taking on additional responsibilities to help us deliver on this.\nSection Title: Leadership updates\nContent:\n**Mark Chen** has stepped into an expanded role as **Chief Research Officer** . Mark will drive scientific progress and make sure we continue to push the frontier in capability and safety. He will tightly integrate research and product development, enabling faster translation of research into products people love. Mark had been at OpenAI for a long time; I have watched him grow from an amazing researcher into an amazing leader over many years. I am not sure I’ve ever seen someone else ever develop as a leader in quite the same way.\nSection Title: Leadership updates\nContent:\n**Brad Lightcap** , as **Chief Operating Officer** , is expanding his role to oversee OpenAI’s business and day-to-day operations. Brad will lead our global deployment, focusing on business strategy, key partnerships, infrastructure, and operational excellence to maximize the impact of our research. Brad and I have worked together for the past 9 years, first at YC and then at OpenAI. It was clear to me 9 years ago that Brad was exceptional and it’s nice to see the rest of the world realize it now; what he has done so far at OpenAI is extraordinary and I look forward to much more in this expanded role.\nSection Title: Leadership updates\nContent:\n**Julia Villagra** has assumed the role of **Chief People Officer** . She will enable the company to continue scaling globally, and will ensure that OpenAI remains the top destination for people who want to build AGI. I haven’t known Julia as long as Mark and Brad, but in the shorter time we’ve worked together, I’ve been extremely impressed by how much she understands the challenges of a rapidly scaling company and builds a culture to support it.\n[2025](/news/?tags=2025)\n[Culture & Careers](/news/?tags=culture-careers)\n ... \nSection Title: Leadership updates > Authors\nContent:\n[Sora Overview](/sora/)\n[Features](/sora/)\n[Pricing](/sora/)\n[Sora log in (opens in a new window)](https://sora.com/)\nAPI Platform\n[Platform Overview](/api/)\n[Pricing](/api/pricing/)\n[API log in (opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/login)\n[Documentation (opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)\n[Developer Forum (opens in a new window)](https://community.openai.com/)\nFor Business\n[Business Overview](/business/)\n[Solutions](/solutions/)\n[Contact Sales](/contact-sales/)\nCompany\n[About Us](/about/)\n[Our Charter](/charter/)\n[Foundation](/foundation/)\n[Careers](/careers/)\n[Brand](/brand/)\nSupport\n[Help Center (opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/)\nMore\n[News](/news/)\n[Stories](/stories/)\n[Livestreams](/live/)\n[Podcast](/podcast/)\n[RSS](https://openai.com/news/rss.xml)\nTerms & Policies\n[Terms of Use](/policies/terms-of-use/)\n[Privacy Policy](/policies/privacy-policy/)\n[Other Policies](/policies/)\nSection Title: Leadership updates > Authors\nContent:\n[(opens in a new window)](https://x.com/OpenAI) [(opens in a new window)](https://www.youtube.com/OpenAI) [(opens in a new window)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai) [(opens in a new window)](https://github.com/openai) [(opens in a new window)](https://www.instagram.com/openai/) [(opens in a new window)](https://www.tiktok.com/@openai) [(opens in a new window)](https://discord.gg/openai)\nOpenAI © 2015–2026 Manage Cookies\nEnglish United States"

Trump Official Presidential Portrait\n\nAfter a landslide election victory in 2024, President Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House to build upon his previous successes and use his mandate to reject the extremist policies of the radical left while providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people.\n\nThis includes putting a stop to endless wars, defending our nation’s borders, and unleashing the potential of the American economy, affording ALL Americans the opportunity to pursue THEIR version of the American dream. [...] Donald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. President Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service.\n\nHe remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office.  He won a second time despite several assassination attempts and the unprecedented weaponization of law fare against him.  Time after time President Trump has defied the odds because he fundamentally believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see our great country succeed. [...] A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, President Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world.\n\nPresident Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic.\n\nPresident Trump has five children, Barron, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as well as 11 grandchildren.\n\nLearn more about First Lady Melania Trump here.\n\n## About\n\n## Media\n\n## Initiatives\n\n### Subscribe to the WH Newsletter",

Trump\nAfter a landslide election victory in 2024, President Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House to build upon his previous successes and use his mandate to reject the extremist policies of the radical left while providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people.\nThis includes putting a stop to endless wars, defending our nation’s borders, and unleashing the potential of the American economy, affording ALL Americans the opportunity to pursue THEIR version of the American dream.\nSection Title: Donald J. Trump\nContent:\nIn his first administration, President Trump passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 3 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nation’s borders in his first four years in office.  This was only the beginning.\nSection Title: Donald J. Trump\nContent:\nDonald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. President Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service.\nHe remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office.  He won a second time despite several assassination attempts and the unprecedented weaponization of law fare against him.  Time after time President Trump has defied the odds because he fundamentally believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see our great country succeed.\nSection Title: Donald J. Trump\nContent:\nA graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, President Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City.
