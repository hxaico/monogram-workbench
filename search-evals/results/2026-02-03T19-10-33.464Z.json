It meant victory over Espanyol would confirm Barca as champions, and they were 2-0 winners at the RCDE Stadium thanks to Lamine Yamal’s 53rd-minute goal and a late Fermin Lopez finish.\n\nAdvertisement [...] It is also a celebration of the Lamine Yamal generation. The 17-year-old gets his first league title (I’m not sure we should count that one 10-minute cameo he made in 2023, last year Barca won La Liga), and he does it as arguably the most influential footballer in the league. He will lead Barcelona’s project, with his generation team-mate Pau Cubarsi, for the foreseeable future adding up to the Pedri and Gavi generation. An excellent core to build on.",

Atletico Madrid meanwhile have only won the double once, with their 1995/96 ‘doblete’ campaign still standing alone as their finest ever season in terms of silverware, although 2013/14 ran it very close! ... Barcelona are the only Spanish team to have completed the treble."

This expansion has allowed more clubs to compete at the highest level of Spanish football.\n\n## Real Madrid vs Barcelona Dominance\n\nThe rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona, known as \"El Clásico,\" has defined La Liga for decades.

This was their first title since 2022-23 and marked their return to the summit of Spanish football.",

The Catalan side now leads Real Madrid by **seven points**, with only six left to play for.\nFC Barcelona have been the most consistent team in LALIGA EA SPORTS 2024/25. Although they trailed the leaders by several points during certain phases of the campaign, an almost perfect second half of the season allowed them to clinch the title\n\n**with two rounds to spare**.\n\nCrucial to this achievement were the two victories over second-place\n**Real Madrid**. FC Barcelona delivered a stunning **0-4 win at the Santiago Bernabéu** in the first half of the season and last week triumphed in a thrilling **ELCLÁSICO** with a **4-3 win**, effectively sealing the title.\n**Lamine Yamal and Raphinha** were decisive in both Clásicos and have been key contributors all season long. The Spaniard and the Brazilian shone on the wings and were arguably the spearhead of a vertical, direct, and lethal team.\nAlso contributing were **Ferran Torres and Robert Lewandowski**, the latter being the team’s **top scorer with 25 goals**; **Pedri**, who served as the team’s midfield compass; and a solid defense featuring standout performances from **centre-back duo Pau Cubarsí and Iñigo Martínez**, along with **Jules Koundé** on the right flank.\nThis is\n\n**FC Barcelona’s 28th LALIGA EA SPORTS title**, putting them second in the all-time list, just behind Real Madrid.\n\n© LALIGA - 2025",

Since the start of the new century, Barcelona won ten La Ligas, including two trebles and four doubles.\nThis new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions.

They became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid's dominion over the league.

They may have slummed in recent times, but they were once a force to reckon with.\n\n## La Liga History and Development\n\nLa Liga, officially known as the Primera División, began in 1929 with 10 founding clubs.\n\n**FC Barcelona won the inaugural championship**, defeating Real Madrid by just two points in a thrilling first season. The competition has grown to become one of the world's most prestigious football leagues.\n\n“La Liga’s history reflects Spain’s tumultuous past. Its only multi-year suspension occurred during the Civil War (1936–39), and in 2020 it was briefly halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic—marking just two pauses across more than nine decades of competition.”— English Wikipedia, “La Liga” and “1939–40 La Liga” entries\n\n### Historical Milestones At A Glance\n\n**Founded:** 1929 | **First Champion:** FC Barcelona | **Most Titles:** Real Madrid (36)\n\n**Total Seasons:** 94 | **Civil War Break:** 1936-39 | **Different Winners:** 9 clubs\n\nThe competition format has undergone significant evolution since its inception. Initially featuring just 10 teams, La Liga expanded to 16 teams in 1934, then to 18 teams in 1971, and finally to the\n\n**current 20-team format in 1997**. This expansion has allowed more clubs to compete at the highest level of Spanish football.\n\n## Real Madrid vs Barcelona Dominance\n\nThe rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona, known as \"El Clásico,\" has defined La Liga for decades. Together,\n\n**these two giants have won 64 of the 94 championships**, representing an extraordinary 68% dominance of Spanish football.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Who has won La Liga the most times?\n\nReal Madrid has won La Liga the most times (36), followed by Barcelona (28). This makes these two clubs by far the most successful in Spanish football history.\n\n### Who won La Liga in 2024-25?\n\nBarcelona won La Liga in the 2024-25 season, securing their 28th title. This was their first title since 2022-23 and marked their return to the summit of Spanish football.",

Xabi Alonso's men, who dominated the game from start to finish, overcame Osasuna on the opening matchday of the season. After a goalless first half, Mbappé, last season's Golden Boot winner, gave the Madridistas the win with a penalty goal early in the second half of the clash. Carreras, who started the game, and Mastantuono made their official debuts for the team.\n#LaLigaHighlights | #RealMadridOsasuna\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",

Xabi Alonso's men, who dominated the game from start to finish, overcame Osasuna on the opening matchday of the season. After a goalless first half, Mbappé, last season's Golden Boot winner, gave the Madridistas the win with a penalty goal early in the second half of the clash. Carreras, who started the game, and Mastantuono made their official debuts for the team.\n#LaLigaHighlights | #RealMadridOsasuna\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",
