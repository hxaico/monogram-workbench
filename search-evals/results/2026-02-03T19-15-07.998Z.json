It meant victory over Espanyol would confirm Barca as champions, and they were 2-0 winners at the RCDE Stadium thanks to Lamine Yamal’s 53rd-minute goal and a late Fermin Lopez finish.\n\nAdvertisement [...] It is also a celebration of the Lamine Yamal generation. The 17-year-old gets his first league title (I’m not sure we should count that one 10-minute cameo he made in 2023, last year Barca won La Liga), and he does it as arguably the most influential footballer in the league. He will lead Barcelona’s project, with his generation team-mate Pau Cubarsi, for the foreseeable future adding up to the Pedri and Gavi generation. An excellent core to build on.",

Atletico Madrid meanwhile have only won the double once, with their 1995/96 ‘doblete’ campaign still standing alone as their finest ever season in terms of silverware, although 2013/14 ran it very close! ... Barcelona are the only Spanish team to have completed the treble."

Although Real Madrid had been prominent, Barcelona created a hegemony in Spain not seen since the Real Madrid of the 1960s–70s. Since the start of the new century, Barcelona won ten La Ligas, including two trebles and four doubles.\nThis new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions.

They became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid's dominion over the league.

The competition has grown to become one of the world's most prestigious football leagues.\n\n“La Liga’s history reflects Spain’s tumultuous past. Its only multi-year suspension occurred during the Civil War (1936–39), and in 2020 it was briefly halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic—marking just two pauses across more than nine decades of competition.”— English Wikipedia, “La Liga” and “1939–40 La Liga” entries\n\n### Historical Milestones At A Glance\n\n**Founded:** 1929 | **First Champion:** FC Barcelona | **Most Titles:** Real Madrid (36)\n\n**Total Seasons:** 94 | **Civil War Break:** 1936-39 | **Different Winners:** 9 clubs\n\nThe competition format has undergone significant evolution since its inception. Initially featuring just 10 teams, La Liga expanded to 16 teams in 1934, then to 18 teams in 1971, and finally to the\n\n**current 20-team format in 1997**. This expansion has allowed more clubs to compete at the highest level of Spanish football.\n\n## Real Madrid vs Barcelona Dominance\n\nThe rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona, known as \"El Clásico,\" has defined La Liga for decades. Together,\n\n**these two giants have won 64 of the 94 championships**, representing an extraordinary 68% dominance of Spanish football.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Who has won La Liga the most times?\n\nReal Madrid has won La Liga the most times (36), followed by Barcelona (28). This makes these two clubs by far the most successful in Spanish football history.\n\n### Who won La Liga in 2024-25?\n\nBarcelona won La Liga in the 2024-25 season, securing their 28th title. This was their first title since 2022-23 and marked their return to the summit of Spanish football.",

Kylian Mbappé's penalty in the 10th minute of stoppage time secured a dramatic 2-1 victory for Real Madrid over lowly Rayo Vallecano to cut Barcelona's lead at the top of LaLiga. In what was an eventful Madrid derby, Real also lost Jude Bellingham to a suspected hamstring injury. The last-gasp victory sees Real trail Barcelona by a single point after 22 league games. A poor Ciss lunge saw Rayo reduced to 10 and Real struck the goal frame again five minutes from when Eduardo Camavinga headed Ceballos' centre onto a post. Batalla foiled Rodrygo from point-blank range deep into stoppage time, but Real blushes were spared as Mbappé kept his composure from 12 yards. | Real Madrid | 22 | 17 | 3 | 2 | +29 | 54 |.
